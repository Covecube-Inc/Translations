## Style Guide

This is for a software application available at https://stablebit.com/DrivePool

It is a COMPUTER DISK pooling application. It combines MULTIPLE real disks into a SINGLE virtual one.

All context is in terms of software.

Special words:

  * *Pool*  - LIKE combination. NOT like swimming pool.
  * *Drive* - LIKE hard drive.
  * *Disk*  - LIKE hard disk.

Special cases:
  
  **StableBit**, **Covecube**, **DrivePool**, **BETA** - Brand names or literates, DO NOT translate

  Please PRESERVE all punctuation AND special characters such as **-,._$^** AND line breaks.

  "Cl_ouds" - In this word, 'o' is a keyboard shortcut. Place the **'_'** symbol in the translated word where appropriate. If not appropriate, then omit it.

  "You have {0} drives part of the pool" - In this case, **'{0}'** is something that will be filled in later automatically. Place **'{0}'** in the translation where appropriate.
